# Pages

Sketch of an idea for tracking pages read in several books at once.

Hypothesis: The primary obstacle to reading many books at once is keeping all of them in one's attention. With the right tool this could be trivial.

Potential Features:

- Set book goals per month
- Sort by which books "need attention"
- Project based on rate whether current goal is resonable
